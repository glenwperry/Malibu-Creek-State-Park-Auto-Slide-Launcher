# auto-running-docent-media
C# console app to auto-launch powerpoint presentations for Malibu Creek State Park Docents.

The docents want to be able to plug in the computer and have the slideshows launch. This allows them to select which slideshow to run by simply pressing a number and hitting enter. It launches an auto-maximized powerpoint show. Just place it in the Startup folder and, if necessary, alter the file paths.
